      # ZipTricks outputs lots of strings in rapid succession, and with
      # servers it can be beneficial to avoid doing too many tiny writes so that
      # the number of syscalls is minimized. See https://github.com/WeTransfer/zip_tricks/issues/78
      # There is a built-in facility for this in ZipTricks which can be used to implement
      # some cheap buffering here (it exists both in version 4 and version 5). The buffer is really
      # tiny and roughly equal to the medium Linux socket buffer size (16 KB). Although output
      # will be not so immediate with this buffering the overall performance will be better,
      # especially with multiple clients being serviced at the same time.
      # Note that the WriteBuffer writes the same, retained String object - but the contents
      # of that object changes between calls. This should work fine with servers where the
      # contents of the string gets written to a socket immediately before the execution inside
      # the WriteBuffer resumes), but if the strings get retained somewhere - like in an Array -
      # this might pose a problem. Unlikely that it will be an issue here though.
